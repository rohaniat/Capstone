## Project Overview

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this capstone project are to:
- Assess and strengthen MAISON’s network security and data protection.
- Develop robust strategies for incident response, business continuity, and risk management.
- Identify and mitigate risks associated with third-party vendors and IoT devices.

### Key Components

1. **Network and Data Security**:
   - Focus on data encryption (TLS, AES-256) and network segmentation to protect sensitive information.
   - Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to maintain system security.

2. **Business Continuity Planning (BCP)**:
   - Covers preparation, response, and recovery for major disruptions, ensuring continuity for essential services.
   - Defines roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols for handling incidents.

3. **Incident Response (IRP)**:
   - Follows the NIST framework, with phases for detection, containment, eradication, and recovery.
   - Utilizes tools like SIEM and EDR to monitor and address security incidents proactively.

4. **Third-Party Risk Management**:
   - Focus on cloud providers, API integrations, and IoT vendors, including a shared responsibility model.
   - Regular audits and compliance checks to manage risks and ensure data security.

5. **Threat Modeling (STRIDE)**:
   - Identification of potential threats like spoofing, tampering, and privilege escalation.
   - Recommended mitigations include MFA, secure API authentication (OAuth2.0), and role-based access controls.

6. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Analyzes risks for cloud infrastructure, API vulnerabilities, and IoT device security.
   - Recommends encryption, access control, and regular audits to mitigate high-impact risks.

## Summary

This project provides a structured approach to securing MAISON's digital infrastructure, from network design and threat detection to incident response and business continuity. Through these combined efforts, MAISON can ensure the protection of customer data, secure cloud and IoT operations, and maintain service resilience.
